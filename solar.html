    <h1>Mercury</h1>
    <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. As such, it circles the sun faster than all the other planets, which is why Romans named it after their swift-footed messenger god.</p>
    <p>The Sumerians also knew of Mercury since at least 5,000 years ago. It was often associated with Nabu, the god of writing. Mercury was also given separate names for its appearance as both a morning star and as an evening star. Greek astronomers knew, however, that the two names referred to the same body, and Heraclitus, around 500 B.C., correctly thought that both Mercury and Venus orbited the sun, not Earth.</p>
    <img src='https://i2.wp.com/www.astronomytrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mercury-1.jpg?fit=678%2C381&ssl=1'>
    <h2>A year on Mercury is just 88 days long.</h2>
    <p>One solar day (the time from noon to noon on the planet’s surface) on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km.</p>
    <h2>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar Systm.</h2>
    <p>One of five planets visible with the naked eye a, Mercury is just 4,879 Kilometres across its equator, compared with 12,742 Kilometres for the Earth.</p>
    <h2>Mercury is the second densest planet. </h2>
    <p>Even though the planet is small, Mercury is very dense. Each cubic centimetre has a density of 5.4 grams, with only the Earth having a higher density. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of heavy metals and rock.</p>
    <h2>Mercury has wrinkles.</h2>
    <p>As the iron core of the planet cooled and contracted, the surface of the planet became wrinkled. Scientist have named these wrinkles, Lobate Scarps. These Scarps can be up to a mile high and hundreds of miles long.</p>

    <h1>Venus</h1>
    <p>Venus, the second planet from the sun, is named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty. The planet — the only planet named after a female — may have been named for the most beautiful deity of her pantheon because it shone the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers.</p>
    <p>In ancient times, Venus was often thought to be two different stars, the evening star and the morning star — that is, the ones that first appeared at sunset and sunrise. In Latin, they were respectively known as Vesper and Lucifer. In Christian times, Lucifer, or "light-bringer," became known as the name of Satan before his fall. However, further observations of Venus in the space age show a very hellish environment. This makes Venus a very difficult planet to observe from up close, because spacecraft do not survive long on its surface.</p>
    <img src='https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2014/2-whatistheave.jpg'>
    <h2>A day on Venus lasts longer than a year. </h2>
    <p>It takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis (sidereal day). The planet’s orbit around the Sun takes 225 Earth days, compared to the Earth’s 365. A day on the surface of Venus (solar day) takes 117 Earth days.</p>
    <h2>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets. </h2>
    <p>This means that Venus is rotating in the opposite direction to the Sun, this is also know as a retrograde rotation. A possible reason might be a collision in the past with an asteroid or other object that caused the planet to alter its rotational path. It also differs from most other planets in our solar systm by having no natural satellites.</p>
    <h2>Venus is the second brightest object in the night sky. </h2>
    <p>Only the Moon is brighter. With a magnitude of between -3.8 to -4.6 Venus is so bright it can be seen during daytime on a clear day.</p>
    <h2>Atmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than the Earth’s. </h2>
    <p>While its size and mass are similar to Earth, the small asteroids are crushed when entering its atmosphere, meaning no small craters lie on the surface of the planet. The pressure felt by a human on the surface would be equivalent to that experienced deep beneath the sea on Earth.</p>

    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It is the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of liquid water on its surface, and, of course, life.</p>
    <p>Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar systm — smaller than the four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranusand Neptune, but larger than the three other rocky planets, </p>

    <h2>The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing.</h2>
    <p>This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.</p>
    <h2>The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe.</h2>
    <p>Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted that the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it. Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus, though this is also not the case.</p>
    <h2>Earth has a powerful magnetic field.</h2>
    <p>This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This field protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.</p>
    <h2>There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth.</h2>
    <p>As a percentage of the size of the body it orbits, the Moon is the largest satellite of any planet in our solar systm. In real terms, however, it is only the fifth largest natural satellite.</p>

    <h1>Mars</h1>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. Befitting the red planet's bloody color, the Romans named it after their god of war. The Romans copied the ancient Greeks, who also named the planet after their god of war, Ares. Other civilizations also typically gave the planet names based on its color — for example, the Egyptians named it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one," while ancient Chinese astronomers dubbed it "the fire star."</p>

    <h2>Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass.</h2>
    <p>Even though Mars has only 15% of the Earth’s volume and just over 10% of the Earth’s mass, around two thirds of the Earth’s surface is covered in water. Martian surface gravity is only 37% of the Earth’s (meaning you could leap nearly three times higher on Mars).</p>
    <h2>Mars is home to the tallest mountain in the solar systm.</h2>
    <p>Olympus Mons, a shield volcano, is 21km high and 600km in diameter. Despite having formed over billions of years, evidence from volcanic lava flows is so recent many scientists believe it could still be active.</p>
    <h2>Only 18 missions to Mars have been successful.</h2>
    <p>As of September 2014 there have been 40 missions to Mars, including orbiters, landers and rovers but not counting flybys. The most recent arrivals include the Mars Curiosity mission in 2012, the MAVEN mission, which arrived on September 22, 2014, followed by the Indian Space Research Organization’s MOM Mangalyaan orbiter, which arrived on September 24, 2014. The next missions to arrive will be the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission, comprising an orbiter, lander, and a rover, followed by NASA’s InSight robotic lander mission, slated for launch in March 2016 and a planned arrival in September, 2016.</p>
    <h2>Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar systm.</h2>
    <p>They can last for months and cover the entire planet. The seasons are extreme because its elliptical (oval-shaped) orbital path around the Sun is more elongated than most other planets in the solar systm.</p>

   <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. Fittingly, it was named after the king of the gods in Roman mythology. In a similar manner, the ancient Greeks named the planet after Zeus, the king of the Greek pantheon.</p>
<p>Jupiter helped revolutionize the way we saw the universe and ourselves in 1610, when Galileo did not make the telescope, but he used it to make several key discoveries. When he turned his telescope toward Jupiter, he discovered four moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto — orbiting it. This was the first time celestial bodies were seen orbiting something other than Earth, which dealt a serious blow to the then-held notion that Earth was the center of the universe.</p>

<h2>Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the solar system. </h2>
<p>Only the Sun, Moon and Venus are more luminous. It is one of five planets visible to the naked eye from Earth.</p>
<h2>Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets. </h2>
<p>It rotates once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. The rapid rotation flattens the planet slightly, giving it an oblate shape.</p>
<h2>Jupiter has 67 moons.</h2>
<p>With the four largest moons being Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, also known as the Galilean moons. They are so named because they were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. The moons are considered some of the most fascinating in the solar system, with the potential for subterranean oceans on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, and the volcanically active surface of Io.</p>
<h2>The Great Red Spot is a giant storm on Jupiter.</h2>
<p>It has raged for at least 350 years. It is so large that three Earths could fit inside it. It is also one of the most mysterious aspects of Jupiter, as astronomers still do not know what causes the storm to persist for so long.</p>

    <h1>Saturn</h1>
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second largest planet in the solar system. Saturn was the Roman name for Cronus, the lord of the Titans in Greek mythology. He was the father of Zeus, or Jupiter, the Roman king of the gods.</p>
    <p>Saturn is famous for its rings, which are made of ice and rock. The rings are so thin that they are only a few hundred meters thick in some places. They are also constantly changing, with new material being added and old material being lost.</p>

    <h2>Saturn is the least dense planet in the solar system.</h2>
    <p>It is the only planet in our solar system that is less dense than water. If you were to put Saturn in a giant bathtub, it would float.</p>
    <h2>Saturn has 82 moons.</h2>
    <p>The largest of Saturn's moons, Titan, is larger than the planet Mercury. Titan is also the only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere. This atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen, with small amounts of methane and other hydrocarbons. It is also home to lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane.</p>
    <h2>The rings of Saturn are not solid.</h2>
    <p>They are made up of billions of small particles, ranging in size from specks of dust to mountains. These particles are thought to be remnants of comets, asteroids, and shattered moons.</p>
    <h2>Saturn's magnetic field is 578 times more powerful than Earth's. </h2>
    <p>This powerful magnetic field causes the spectacular auroras that can be seen at Saturn's poles. It also protects the planet from the solar wind.</p>

    <h1>Uranus</h1>
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun. It was the first planet to be discovered by scientists, as it is not visible to the naked eye. The planet is notable for its dramatic tilt, which causes its axis to point nearly directly at the sun.</p>
    <p>This dramatic tilt also means that a day on Uranus is not like a day on Earth. One pole of Uranus is in darkness for 42 years, while the other pole is in sunlight for 42 years. This is because Uranus's axis of rotation is tilted at an angle of 97.77 degrees to its orbit around the sun.</p>

    <h2>Uranus is an ice giant.</h2>
    <p>It is made of a thick fluid of "icy" materials — water, methane, and ammonia — above a small rocky center. The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a little methane.</p>
    <h2>Uranus has 27 moons.</h2>
    <p>The moons are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The largest of the moons are Titania, Oberon, Ariel, Umbriel and Miranda. All of them are made of ice and rock.</p>
    <h2>Uranus has a very cold atmosphere.</h2>
    <p>The atmosphere of Uranus is the coldest in the solar system, with a minimum temperature of -224 °C. This is because it has a lower internal temperature than all the other planets.</p>

    <h1>Neptune</h1>
    <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-most-massive planet. Among the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.</p>
    <p>Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea. The planet's blue color is a result of methane in its atmosphere. Neptune is the second ice giant in the outer solar system, after Uranus. It is a very cold and windy planet, with the fastest winds recorded in the solar system.</p>
    <img src='https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/647712main_neptune_clouds.jpg'>
    <h2>A year on Neptune is 165 Earth years long.</h2>
    <p>This is because it takes Neptune 165 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. A day on Neptune, however, is much shorter, lasting only about 16 hours.</p>
    <h2>Neptune has 14 moons.</h2>
    <p>The largest moon is Triton, which is unusual because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction to the planet's rotation. Triton is also the coldest object ever measured in the solar system, with a surface temperature of -240 °C.</p>
    <h2>Neptune has a very turbulent atmosphere.</h2>
    <p>It is known for its dramatic weather systems, including the Great Dark Spot, a massive storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The winds on Neptune can reach speeds of up to 2,100 km/h, the fastest recorded on any planet in the solar system.</p>
    <h2>Neptune's rings are faint and difficult to see.</h2>
    <p>Unlike Saturn's spectacular rings, Neptune's rings are very faint and are made of very dark particles. They were first discovered by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989.</p>

    <h1>Pluto</h1>
    <p>Pluto, once considered the ninth and most distant planet from the sun, is now the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system. It was reclassified in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) because it did not meet all three criteria to be a full-fledged planet.</p>
    <p>Pluto is a very cold and dark world, located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. It has a very eccentric orbit, which means its distance from the sun varies greatly. At its closest point, it is about 30 AU from the sun, while at its farthest point, it is nearly 50 AU away.</p>

    <h2>A year on Pluto is 248 Earth years long.</h2>
    <p>This is because it takes Pluto 248 Earth years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. A day on Pluto lasts for about 6.4 Earth days.</p>
    <h2>Pluto has five known moons.</h2>
    <p>The largest of Pluto's moons is Charon, which is so large that the two bodies are sometimes referred to as a "double dwarf planet." The other four moons are Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.</p>
    <h2>Pluto's atmosphere is very thin.</h2>
    <p>It is made mostly of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide. The atmosphere freezes and falls to the surface as snow when Pluto is at its farthest point from the sun.</p>
    <h2>Pluto is a very diverse world.</h2>
    <p>In 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto and discovered a world with a surprising amount of geological activity, including mountains of water ice, vast plains of nitrogen ice and even what appears to be a large, heart-shaped glacier.</p>
